# hello-world
This is the first repository I have created.

This is the README file, where presumably anything one might need to know about this file/project/repository could be found. Seeing as this is my first repository, this readme file will unfortunately have to remain fairly bare...but I  understand the significance of the readme file and the importance of such a file in the long term.

Having since created a new branch, I will edit this readme file and commit the changes so as to differentiate this branch from the original branch and create a new version of this project.

I have recently graduated from the University of Vermont and I am looking to do some kind of work with computer science, although I am not quite sure where I'm at yet with that. Hopefully using GitHub/VC can help make working on projects easier in addition to providing a great resource for understanding the history of a project and keeping it well-organized.
